This Project has been created by Shaurya Rawat MBD O-1 towards of the completion of the course NLP by Professor Daniel Micol which results in the completion of it for the Masters in Business Analytics and Big data. 

Libraries Used:
Tweepy
Scikit-Learn
NLTK
Vincent
Matplotlib

Steam_trump is the json file where the tweets get stored automatically.
positive and negative.txt are the files required to train the dataset into recognizing positive and negative sentiments and are labelled. 
testData is used to test the results of the model created using Naive Bayes.
pickled_algos contains the pickled byte streams of the various algorithms used for training the model. NLP_final.py is the file with the code. 

chart.html is required to run the D3.js in the backend and term_freq.json is the file in which the output of the vincent library code on which the graph is created is stored.

TO view the graphs, go to cmd and type:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

And navigate to localhost:8888 and the directory where chart.html is stored. On clicking the chart.html file, the graph is presented.


I hope you like the project.
